# aNLI-task-project

This repository contains code for addressing the Abductive Natural Language Inference (aNLI) commonsense reasoning benchmark. The aNLI dataset challenges AI systems to use abductive reasoning and common sense to generate likely explanations for observed events. Framed as a binary classification task, the objective is to select the most plausible explanatory hypothesis given two narrative-based observations.
